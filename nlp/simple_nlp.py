    Minimal NLP utilities (no regex, no external libs).
    Features:
      1) Remove stop words
      2) Document -> sentences
      3) Sentence -> word tokens

    Design choices:
      - Unicode-aware via str.isalnum().
      - Keeps internal apostrophes/hyphens inside tokens (e.g., "don't", "rock-n-roll").
      - Simple sentence splitter on ., !, ?, â€¦ with a small abbreviation skip list.
